# muzak2yt
Upload your favorite music albums directly to YouTube !

Program written under Python 3.9

## Requirements

The following modules need to be installed with pip :

* youtube_uploader_selenium==0.1.0
* oauth2client==4.1.3
* httplib2==0.19.0
* fleep==1.0.1
* mutagen==1.45.1
* google_api_python_client==1.12.8

In addition, the following conditions need to be fullfiled :

* You must have [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed (and added to your PATH if you're on Windows)
* You must have Firefox installed, as well as [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) (add to your PATH or drag and drop in your Python folder)


## Usage


1. Add an image to your album folder that will be used by ffmpeg to generate the video. The image has to be named "image.png", as well as having even width and height values (640x480 is ok, 641x480 is not)
2. Run the "tagging.py" file in the same folder as your music album.
3. Once the video is generated by ffmpeg, it will be uploaded to YouTube. The script will automatically open FireFox, you need to connect to YouTube manually the first time.


## Additional Notes

* If your video titles are messed up by the script, follow this guide : ["Title not setting correctly"](https://github.com/linouk23/youtube_uploader_selenium/issues/4) (The init.py file will be in your site-packages/youtube-uploader-selenium folder (you can run **python -c 'import site; print(site.getsitepackages())'** to get the location)
* If you want ffmpeg to overwrite the existing mp4 files, replace the argument "-n" by "-y" in the **subprocess.call**
* If you want to modify the way titles and descriptions are generated, edit the following lines :
```python
metadata = {
                "title":  title,
                "description": "Album: " + str(audio["album"]).strip('[\']') + "\nArtist(s): " + str(audio["artist"]).strip('[\']').replace("\"", "")
            }
```

* If you don't want to upload the video to YouTube, comment out the following part of the code (I should probably handle this with an optionnal argument inside the program itself):

```python
uploader = YouTubeUploader(video_path, metadata_path)
was_video_uploaded, video_id = uploader.upload()
assert was_video_uploaded
```
